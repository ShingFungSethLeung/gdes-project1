        <p class="right-text">The Tang Dynasty (618 to 907 AD) is often regarded as a high point in Chinese civilization, known for its cultural, political, and economic achievements. Founded by Emperor Gaozu, the dynasty established a strong centralized government and expanded the civil service examination system, promoting meritocracy in government positions. The Tang era saw significant advancements in art, literature, and technology, with poetry flourishing under influential poets like Li Bai and Du Fu. Additionally, the Silk Road trade routes thrived, facilitating cultural exchange and economic prosperity.</p>

            <p class="left-text">The Tang Dynasty also faced internal strife, including rebellions and regional military autonomy, which ultimately contributed to its decline. The An Lushan Rebellion (755â€“763 AD) was a significant turning point, leading to widespread devastation and weakening central authority. Despite its eventual fall, the Tang Dynasty left a lasting legacy on Chinese culture, governance, and influence, shaping the future of the region for centuries to come.
