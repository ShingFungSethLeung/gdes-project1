        <p class="right-text">The Qing Dynasty, which ruled China from 1644 to 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of the country and marked a significant era of expansion and cultural exchange. Established by the Manchus, the Qing Dynasty expanded China's territory to its greatest extent, incorporating regions such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Mongolia. This period is characterized by a flourishing of arts and culture, with advancements in literature, painting, and philosophy. The Kangxi and Qianlong emperors, in particular, are noted for their patronage of the arts and efforts to consolidate power, leading to a golden age of Chinese culture.</p>

            <p class="left-text">However, the Qing Dynasty also faced numerous challenges, including internal rebellions, social unrest, and pressures from foreign powers. The Opium Wars in the 19th century marked a turning point, leading to significant territorial concessions and the signing of unequal treaties that weakened China's sovereignty. By the early 20th century, widespread dissatisfaction culminated in the Xinhai Revolution, which led to the abdication of the last emperor, Puyi, and the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912. The Qing Dynasty's legacy remains influential, shaping modern China's social, political, and cultural landscape.</p>
