        <p class="right-text">The Song Dynasty (960 to 1279 AD) is renowned for its cultural and technological advancements, as well as its economic prosperity. It is divided into two periods: the Northern Song (960 to 1127) and the Southern Song (1127 to 1279). The dynasty is noted for its emphasis on civil governance, with the expansion of the civil service examination system that favored merit over aristocratic birth. This led to a flourishing of arts and culture, with significant achievements in painting, poetry, and ceramics. Innovations such as gunpowder, the compass, and printing technology also emerged during this time, contributing to societal progress.</p>

            <p class="left-text">Despite its achievements, the Song Dynasty faced military challenges, particularly from nomadic groups in the north. The Northern Song fell to the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty in 1127, prompting the court to relocate southward, marking the beginning of the Southern Song period. While the Southern Song continued to thrive culturally and economically, it ultimately succumbed to the Mongol invasions, leading to the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty. The Song Dynasty's legacy endures, influencing Chinese culture and governance long after its fall.
